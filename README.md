# PlanetDestroyer
Just playing around with c++ glm opengl assimp and sdl2 for the olc-beat-the-boredom jam.<br>
https://itch.io/jam/olc-beat-the-boredom
<br>
<br>
There is a precompiled binary (debug version) for windows in bin directory, just unzip and run.<br>
<br>
For Linux just run "make && bin/engine"<br>
Dependencies: glm, assimp, glew, soil, opengl, sdl2<br>
<br>
<br>
Keys used <br>
manuvering: WASD and arrow keys <br>
fast forward/reverse: mouse scroll wheel. <br>
regenerate those 10 planets again: p<br>
wireframe mode: ctrl-l<br>
level camera: ctrl-c<br>
reset orientation: ctrl-g   (if you become desoriented when the keys goes in reverse directions :-D )<br>
respawn ship: ctrl-b<br>
slow down: hold shift<br>
speed up: hold ctrl<br>
Exit:  escape<br>
<br>
There is no plot, no points, no text, no sound, not actually a game. just fly around and collide with the planets to get ridd of them. When all planets are gone they respawn<br>
