# PlanetDestroyer
Just playing around with c++ glm opengl assimp and sdl2 for the olc-beat-the-boredom jam.<br>
https://itch.io/jam/olc-beat-the-boredom

There is a precompiled binary (debug version) for windows in bin directory, just unzip and run.

For Linux just run "make && bin/engine"
Dependencies: glm, assimp, glew, soil, opengl, sdl2


Keys used 
manuvering: WASD and arrow keys 
fast forward/reverse: mouse scroll wheel. 
regenerate those 10 planets again: p
wireframe mode: ctrl-l
level camera: ctrl-c
reset orientation: ctrl-g   (if you become desoriented when the keys goes in reverse directions :-D )
respawn ship: ctrl-b
slow down: hold shift
speed up: hold ctrl
Exit:  escape

There is no plot, no points, no text, no sound, not actually a game. just fly around and collide in the planets to get ridd of them.
